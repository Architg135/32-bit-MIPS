# 32-bit-MIPS
The Verilog code implements a basic MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) pipeline processor. The processor operates in a pipelined manner, with instructions passing through several stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).
